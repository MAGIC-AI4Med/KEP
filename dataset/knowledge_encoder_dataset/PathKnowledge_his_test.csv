02296_t006_histology	LCIS involves the terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU), filling and distending acini more than 50% of the acini in a TDLU must be filled and expanded to qualify as LCIS; otherwise, called atypical lobular neoplasia Lobular distention is defined as the presence of more than 8 cells in the cross sectional diameter of an acinus Involved lobules may be compared with uninvolved lobules to estimate the degree of distension, ALH only partially involves the lobule by filling up the acini without significant distention LCIS most often involves lobules but may also grow along the basement membrane of ducts (i.e., pagetoid spread) Pagetoid spread in ducts is the characteristic growth of cells between luminal and myoepithelial layers of a duct without destroying ductal epithelium or filling up ductal lumina, Often makes the ducts appear convoluted; this is called a cloverleaf pattern LCIS may secondarily involve sclerosing adenosis, radial scar, fibroadenoma, collagenous spherulosis or papilloma Rosen triad: the presence of tubular carcinoma, columnar cell lesions and LCIS / ALH Initial morphologic observation of lesions that are genetically linked Classic LCIS cells are monomorphic, evenly spaced, loosely cohesive and do not show polarization or gland formation 2 types of cells are described: Type A: nuclei are small to slightly enlarged (1 - 1.5x size of lymphocyte) with uniform round nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli, Type B: nuclei larger (2x size of lymphocyte), more abundant cytoplasm and more prominent nucleoli, Type A and B cells can coexist in the same lesion Cytoplasm of LCIS cells is typically pale to lightly eosinophilic with indistinct cell borders In almost all cases of LCIS, at least some cells contain intracytoplasmic vacuoles or lumina, which may contain an eosinophilic globule; this feature is not specific to LCIS Vacuoles may be subtle such that special histochemical stains for mucin are required in order to demonstrate; alternatively, they may be large enough to push the nucleus against the cell membrane and produce signet ring cell forms Outer layer of myoepithelial cells is retained in the acini and ducts involved but it may be attenuated In some cases, scattered myoepithelial cells can be admixed with the neoplastic epithelial cells within the involved spaces, Myoepithelial cells show weak positivity for E-cadherin due to the cross reactivity of P-cadherin Cytologic or architectural features of LCIS may deviate from the classical appearances and exhibit distinct cell membranes, clear cell change or apocrine change, or have a myoid appearance with dark, eccentric nuclei and dense eosinophilic cytoplasm similar to rhabdomyoblasts Classic LCIS does not show significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitosis Classic LCIS may rarely display single cell apoptosis or minute foci of necrosis but typically does not show comedo type necrosis Rarely, comedo necrosis can be present in classic LCIS that has typical cytological and architectural features; this should not be diagnosed as pleomorphic LCIS  Pleomorphic LCIS is defined as having large cells with enlarged pleomorphic nuclei; additionally, central necrosis and apocrine features can be present Florid LCIS, with or without central necrosis, refers to lesions with cytologic features of classic LCIS but with marked duct distension in a solid architectural pattern LCIS lesions, which are borderline between classic LCIS composed of type B cells and pleomorphic LCIS, should be categorized as classic LCIS composed of type B cells Lesions with cytological features of classic LCIS, which show distension of the acini borderline between classic LCIS and florid LCIS, should be designated as classic LCIS, even when LCIS is extensive

00952_t005_histology	Mucosa is composed of the epithelium, lamina propria and muscularis mucosa Epithelium: colonic epithelium is composed of a single layer of the absorptive columnar cells and the goblet cells As the epithelium invaginates into the underlying lamina propria, it forms glandular structures called crypts, arranged in a characteristic parallel test tube-like pattern Crypt is a functional unit of colon and is primarily lined by the goblet cells Crypt also has enteroendocrine cells, Paneth cells and stem cells located at its base During the maturation process, the mature epithelial cells migrate toward the surface of the epithelium (luminal migration), while the immature (stem cells) are at the base of the crypts On maturation, the Paneth cells migrate to the base of the crypt, instead of the luminal migration Enteroendocrine cells also stay in the deeper portion of the crypt and in the middle of the tubule Absorptive cells: predominant cells in the right colon Columnar cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, basally located nuclei, small apical mucin vacuoles and apical microvilli, Primarily line the surface epithelium Goblet cells: predominant cells in the left colon Large cells with intracytoplasmic mucin and basally located hyperchromatic nuclei, Mucin composition of goblet cells is different from the mucin in the absorptive cells (Histopathology 2000;37:561) Other cell types of the epithelium: Enteroendocrine cells: Located at the base of the crypts and have eosinophilic secretory granules in the cytoplasm with apically located nuclei Apical location of the nuclei helps to differentiate these cells from the Paneth cells Paneth cells: Paneth cells have a triangular shape with densely eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules Nuclei are basally located, unlike enteroendocrine cells described above, a distinction important in the left colon, since the presence of Paneth cells in this part of colon is abnormal and could be a sign of chronic injury M cells: typically not identified on routine histology Usually associated with lymphoid follicles and seen best with electron microscopy Lamina propria: Loose connective tissue rich in capillaries and lymphatics, Supports the crypts and consists of supportive mesenchymal cells and inflammatory cells, Mesenchymal cells are divided into 2 types: pericrypt myofibroblasts and subepithelial myofibroblasts, Inflammatory cells vary in type and number Presence of eosinophils, macrophages, lymphocytes and mast cells is normal Plasma cells are also normally present and predominantly secrete IgA Presence of neutrophils in large number is abnormal , Muscularis mucosa: Muscularis mucosa consists of thin strands of smooth muscle fibers separating the mucosa and submucosa Presence of muscularis mucosae in biopsies is critical to evaluate for architectural distortion , Submucosa: Consists of loose connective tissue, thin smooth muscle bundles, nerve plexuses (Meissner plexus and Henle deep submucosal plexus) with ganglion cells, stromal cells, adipose tissue and vasculature Well circumscribed areas of adipose tissue forming a discrete mass within the submucosa may represent lipomas and may present as a mass on endoscopy Mucosal lymphoid aggregates or follicles may extend into submucosa, which may contain the crypts, so called lymphoglandular complex mimicking invasive carcinoma in the submucosa Muscularis propria: Consists of inner circular layer and outer longitudinal layer and Auerbach nerve plexus in between the 2 muscle layers Interstitial cells of Cajal are present within the muscularis propria and play a role in peristalsis Subserosa and serosa: subserosa is composed of fibroadipose tissue and is covered by the serosa lined by cuboidal mesothelial cells, , Rectum: a continuation of the sigmoid colon with thicker mucosa and longer crypts primarily lined by the goblet cells; the mucosa gradually transitions from columnar to squamous from the rectum into the anal canal, , References: Westerhoff: Histology for Pathologists, 5th Edition, 2019, Kierszenbaum: Histology and Cell Biology - An Introduction to Pathologists, 5th Edition, 2019,

03796_t005_main	serrated lesions
03796_t005_histology	Hyperplastic polyps: Superficial serrated epithelium and funnel shaped, evenly spaced crypts, Proliferative zones confined to crypt bases, No basal dilatation, architecture distortion or submucosal misplacement, No cytologic dysplasia, Individual crypt branching may occur, Microvesicular hyperplastic polyps: Microvesicular: abundant cytoplasm with fine apical vacuoles, occasional goblet cells present Cross sections of crypts: stellate lumina (star shaped) Diagnosis of exclusion: other criteria of sessile serrated lesions are not met Goblet cell hyperplastic polyps: Subtle superficial epithelial serrations, mimicking reactive epithelium or hyperplasia, thus easily overlooked Goblet cell only in epithelium; no microvesicular cell Cross sections of crypt: round, not stellate , Sessile serrated lesions: Crypts with prominent serrations and overall architecture distortion, defined as unequivocal presence of at least 1 of the following features: Horizontal growth along the muscularis mucosae, Dilation of the crypt base (basal third of the crypt), Serrations extending into the crypt base, Asymmetrical proliferation Branching of crypts is not sufficient for diagnosis Size, location and endoscopic appearance alone should not be used to make the diagnosis of sessile serrated lesions but can be helpful when diagnostic features are ambiguous or in tangential sectioned specimen Deeper levels may be helpful for poorly oriented specimen Potential pitfall: mucosal herniation by smooth muscle fibers Mucosal herniation often associated with lipomatous areas or lymphoid aggregates Microvesicular hyperplastic polyps and sessile serrated lesions can be associated with stromal proliferation resembling perineural cells  Sessile serrated lesions with dysplasia: 2 - 5% of all sessile serrated lesions, Dysplastic areas are usually sharply demarcated from the nondysplastic areas (abrupt transition), Heterogenous morphology (multiple dysplastic patterns) within single lesion, Architectural changes including: Crowding of crypts with complex branching Excessive or reduced luminal serration Cytological changes including: Intestinal dysplasia, mimicking tubular adenoma Eosinophilic cytoplasm Increased mitoses 4 dysplasia patterns described in sessile serrated lesions : Dysplasia, not otherwise specified: Most common pattern, Easily identifiable architectural changes and obvious cytologic atypia, Frequently associated with MLH1 loss Minimal deviation: Subtle architectural changes (crypt crowding), Cells with hypermucinous cytoplasm or gastric type change, Mild hyperchromasia, Mitotic figures present at higher part of the crypts, Requires MLH1 loss for diagnosis Serrated dysplasia: Dense eosinophilic appearance at low magnification, Closely packed small glands with reduced serration and cribriforming, Marked nuclear atypia, Rarely associated with MLH1 loss (retained MLH1 expression) Adenomatous dysplasia: similar appearance to conventional adenomas; rarely associated with MLH1 loss Multiple patterns are often found in a single lesion, Loss of MLH1 expression is not specific for sessile serrated lesions with dysplasia but can help when dysplastic features are subtle, Grading of dysplasia is not recommended because of low reproducibility, high heterogeneity of the lesion and lack of correlation of MLH1 expression loss (Mod Pathol 2017;30:1728, Histopathology 2015;66:49) Traditional serrated adenomas: 3 major morphologic features : Slit-like serration (mimicking small intestinal mucosa) Tall columnar cells with intense eosinophilic cytoplasm and bland elongated nuclei Ectopic crypt formations Epithelial buds not connected to the muscularis mucosae, Can have mild atypia; often with cell crowding and frequent mitoses, Always noted in polypoid traditional serrated adenomas; less common in flat traditional serrated adenomas Diagnosis: more than 2 major morphologic features present in more than 50% of the polyp Other common histological features: tubulovillous architecture, intraepithelial lymphocytes  Often adjacent / associated with a precursor polyp (hyperplastic polyps or sessile serrated lesions) Variants: Goblet cell rich / mucinous traditional serrated adenomas: traditional serrated adenomas with a lot of goblet cells, Filiform traditional serrated adenomas: traditional serrated adenomas with bulbous and edematous tips of villi Traditional serrated adenomas with overt dysplasia: Intestinal type dysplasia: resembling dysplasia seen in conventional adenoma Serrated type dysplasia: resembling serrated type dysplasia seen in sessile serrated lesions No specific surveillance guidelines;

03767_t011_histology	According to Zurich classification, pathology is a secondary classification criterion serving to confirm the diagnosis of osteomyelitis if clinical judgment and diagnostic imaging are inconclusive  Histology of jaw osteomyelitis should always be complemented and interpreted in conjunction with clinical and radiological findings and should NOT be used independently Histology is also essential to exclude differential diagnoses A clear distinction of primary and secondary chronic osteomyelitis solely based on histopathology is not always possible but may be helpful in context with clinical presentation and imaging studies When few clinical signs of suppuration (pus, fistula, sequestra) are evident, histopathology resembles typical appearance of chronic osteomyelitis with no clear distinction of primary and secondary chronic forms An important purpose of histopathological investigation - beyond the confirmation of a clinically and radiologically suspected diagnosis of osteomyelitis - consists of typing and grading of the inflammatory activity; this may help distinguish secondary chronic osteomyelitis from primary chronic osteomyelitis in some cases when clinical course and imaging studies are inconclusive Histopathology in cases of secondary chronic osteomyelitis with significant suppuration demonstrates similar features as acute osteomyelitis with large amounts of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells, accompanied by a variable degree of marrow fibrosis and reactive bone formation Cases of secondary chronic osteomyelitis with a less fulminant (e.g., more chronic) course have lymphocytic infiltrate, marrow fibrosis, reactive woven bone formation, minimal marrow adipose Periosteum still contains osteogenic potential in most cases, which contributes to formation of a bony shell (involucrum) covering the sequestra The involucrum may interfere with extrusion of the sequestrum, which may perpetuate the process, in combination with a compromised blood supply and the presence of organisms

03087_t017_histology	Ovarian parenchyma can largely be divided into 3 compartments: Albuginea: a protective hypocellular compartment, composed of a fibrotic layer measuring approximately 0.3 mm and occupying the most superficial part of the ovary , Cortex: a 0.3 mm hypercellular layer composed of spindle cells arranged parallel to the surface and housing the majority of the follicles in a premenopausal woman , Medulla: a hypocellular area beneath the cellular cortex and housing abundant blood vessels; nodular or diffuse proliferation of spindle cells can commonly be seen in the medulla  Stroma: Comprises bulk of ovarian tissue, Resembles fibroblasts in whorls / storiform pattern surrounded by dense reticulin network, Contains luteinized stromal cells, decidual cells, smooth muscle, fat, neuroendocrine cells and endometrial stroma-like cells Ovarian parenchyma can alternatively be defined as the ovarian follicles, given that the follicles are the constituents that perform the function of the ovary with all the other constituents being labeled as ovarian stroma (Reproduction 2020;160:R25) Number of primordial follicles and oocytes in premenopausal women can be markedly different between the 2 ovaries , Within the same ovary, the primordial follicles and oocytes exhibit an uneven distribution in the cortex with clustering in few areas , In addition to their more common location in the cortex, the primordial follicles can be seen in the medulla within areas of nodular proliferations, especially in women with abundant follicular cysts , Follicle is designated cystic when it measures 2 mm or more but less than 9 mm; these are very common and can be lateralized to 1 ovary in some individuals  Stages of follicular development: Primordial follicle: Diplotene oocyte surrounded by a layer of flattened granulosa cells  Neo-oogenesis may occur in adults (Endocrine 2005;26:301) Maturing follicle: Oocyte with surrounding granulosa cell layer Contains Call-Exner bodies (rosette-like formations with central filamentous / eosinophilic material consisting of excess basal lamina) and theca cells (within follicle are luteinized and produce sex hormones, external to follicle are very cellular) Corpus luteum: 2 cm, round to serpiginous, yellow, lobulated structure with cystic center Has luteinized granulosa and theca cells In pregnancy, is larger, bright yellow with prominent central cavity, hyaline droplets and calcification Corpus albicans: remnant of corpus luteum, hyalinized, paucicellular fibrotic scar with serpiginous contours Other normal components: Surface epithelium: Ovarian surface epithelium is a modified mesothelium, also called coelomic or germinal epithelium  Single layer of flat to cuboidal mesothelial type cells, which appear to actively participate in the ovulatory rupture and repair process  Closely related to M llerian duct lining epithelium Mesothelial inclusion cyst: Superficial cysts that are lined by mesothelial cells and represent invagination of the surface mesothelial epithelium Usually seen in ovaries with clefts Endosalpingiosis: Group of glands and cysts with a tubal epithelial lining Usually seen in ovaries without clefts and commonly associated with calcification Rim of fibrotic tissue can surround them  In contrast to inclusion cysts, their presence can be associated with the recurrence of low grade serous neoplasms Hilus (hilar) cells: Located in ovarian medulla, rarely within ovarian stroma; located away from the hilum, round to polygonal, epithelial appearing, presumed vestigial remnant of gonad from its ambisexual phase Closely associated with large hilar veins and lymphatics and may protrude within their lumina;

00263_t031_histology	Chorionic plate (fetal surface)Covered by a layer of amnion and chorion, Accumulation of fibrin beneath the chorionic plate is a common finding at term and is visible as tan-white plaques, Primary stem villi protrude perpendicularly downward from the chorionic plate, Microscopically, the chorionic plate and stem villi, both primary and secondary, are composed of dense collagenized connective tissue surrounding thick walled arteries and veins Basal plate (maternal surface)Consists of fibrin, extravillous trophoblast cells, decidua basalis and maternal blood vessels, Endometrial spiral arteries undergo physiological transformation characterized by lumen dilation, extravillous trophoblast invasion of the endothelial lining and fibrinoid replacement of the muscular and elastic tissue of the arterial wall , Therefore, maternal spiral arteries transform from high resistance, low capacitance to low resistance, high capacitance vessels, Maternal veins generally run parallel to the basal plate and are less conspicuous, Contour of the basal plate is coarsely folded, forming clefts known as placental septa that protrude into the parenchyma and can extend as far as the fetal surface, Insertion site of the anchoring villi into maternal endometrium, Invasive intermediate trophoblasts are seen here MembranesComposed of amnion, intermediate or spongy layer (reticular zone that represents remnants of the coelomic cavity), chorion laeve and chorion frondosum, Membrane layers adhere together but can be peeled apart with minimal effort, Amnion: innermost covering of amniotic cavity that is closest to the fetus; thin, avascular layer composed of cuboidal to low columnar epithelial cells that rest on a thin basement membrane with underlying thin band of loose connective tissue (spindled to stellate mesenchymal cells) May show squamous metaplasia (plaques of keratinizing, stratified squamous epithelium), especially near umbilical cord insertion Present as small gray nodules of 3 - 4 mm in diameter and should be distinguished from amnion nodosum Squamous metaplasia is a normal variant (seen in nearly 50% of term placentas), while amnion nodosum is pathological and is strongly associated with longstanding oligohydramnios Intermediate or spongy layer: potential space between the amnion and chorion, which results from incomplete fusion of amnionic and chorionic mesoderm during early pregnancy; this intermediate layer is composed of loosely arranged bundles of collagen fibers with a few scattered fibroblasts, separated by a communicating system of clefts and allows the membranes to slide against each other, Chorion: connective tissue membrane containing fetal vessels, internal to amnion, external to villi, Membranous chorion (chorion laeve): formed by the collapse of the intervillous space during development; composed of mononuclear, sometimes vacuolated, extravillous trophoblast and scattered atrophic chorionic villi, Decidual chorion (chorion frondosum): located in the placenta proper; it eventually fuses with the parietal decidua, thereby obliterating the uterine cavity (Front Bioeng Biotechnol 2020;8:610544) Umbilical cord2 umbilical arteries have slightly thicker, double layered muscular walls without an elastic layer , Single umbilical vein has a thinner muscular wall containing a subintimal elastic layer, Intervening Wharton jelly contains loose ground substance, a fine network of microfibrils and scattered nucleated cells (predominantly macrophages, myofibroblasts and mast cells), Umbilical cord is surfaced by a single layer of amnion, which is continuous with the surface of the placenta and the fetal skin, A single umbilical artery is present in ~1% of cases, Vessels branch out over the fetal surface to form the villous tree Placental villiComprised of capillaries, fetal macrophages and perivascular fibroblasts without associated collagen; the surrounding trophoblast bilayer consists of an outer syncytiotrophoblast layer and inner cytotrophoblast layer, Site of gas exchange, metabolic and endocrine activities, Dual blood supply from both the fetal and maternal circulations, Villous trees are made up of ~40 major primary stem villi, each measuring 0.2 - 1.5 mm in diameter, which protrude perpendicularly downward from the chorionic plate; contain arteries, veins, fibrous stroma and capillaries, Primary villi separate into 4 - 8 secondary stem villi, which travel parallel to the chorionic plate, These secondary stem villi further divide into tertiary stem villi, which form the placental lobules and insert into the basal plate, Villi types evolve during pregnancy: immature intermediate villi are dominant in early pregnancy; mature intermediate branch into terminal villi represent the main exchange area of the third trimester placenta Cytotrophoblast cellsPresent in early gestation; differentiates into villous or extravillous trophoblast and forms syncytiotrophoblasts by fusing on villous surface, During early pregnancy, this layer is nearly complete but later in gestation it becomes discontinuous and is inconspicuous in term placenta, Cuboidal, polyhedral or ovoid cells with well demarcated cell borders and large, lightly staining nuclei containing finely dispersed chromatin, Cytoplasm is usually clear to slightly granular and somewhat basophilic, Mitotic figures are occasionally found Extravillous (X cells) or intermediate trophoblast cellsOld literature described extravillous trophoblast as intermediate trophoblast, as the morphology appeared intermediate between cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast, Infiltrate decidua and myometrium of placental site, invade and replace spiral arteries of the basal plate to establish maternal - fetal circulation and keep vessels patent , Form trophoblastic shell, Secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) related protein, Located in the basal plate, septa and chorion laeve; morphology varies by location, In the basal plate, they are enlarged polyhedral to spindle cells with abundant amphophilic and vacuolated cytoplasmic and large, hyperchromatic nuclei; may resemble adjacent decidua, In myometrium, they are more spindled and resemble adjacent smooth muscle cells; may fuse to become multinucleated cells Intraplacental trophoblast islandsForm the inner layer of the villous trophoblastic mantle and play an important role in maintaining the structural integrity of the villi, Serve as a source from which implantation site and chorionic type intermediate trophoblast cells are derived, Larger than cytotrophoblasts, mononucleate, polygonal, abundant pale to clear cytoplasm, distinct cell borders and single nuclei, Frequently, the islands contain villous remnants with perivillous fibrin Syncytiotrophoblast cellsSingle, continuous, normally uninterrupted layer that extends over the surfaces of all villous trees and chorionic villi as well as over parts of the inner surfaces of chorionic and basal plates, Synthesize and secrete hCG, hPL, Multinucleated giant cells with abundant homogeneous to finely granular, somewhat basophilic cytoplasm, often with multiple intracytoplasmic vacuoles and small dense pyknotic nuclei with moderately dense chromatin Hofbauer cellsFetal macrophages located in villous stroma, 10 - 35 m in diameter, Present from 18 days postconception and throughout gestation, 4 subtypes according to differences in the expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) type II complement receptors, lectins, lipopolysaccharide coreceptor (CD14) and CD68 , Round to ovoid cells with eccentric nuclei and granular cytoplasm with many vacuoles containing flocculent material and occasional osmiophilic bodies, Their most important function is the immunological defense of the fetus and the prevention of vertical transmission of pathogens,

01672_t023_main	gleason grading
01672_t023_histology	Discontinued Gleason grades 1 and 2 It was agreed at the 2014 consensus conference that Gleason grades 1 and 2 should be discontinued because grade 1 or 2 cancer in needle biopsy does not predict better prostatectomy findings than grade 3 and these grades show marked interpathologist variability Gleason score of 1+1=2 was originally described as single, separate, closely packed, uniform round glands arranged in a circumscribed nodule with pushing borders; many of such cases would, with the benefit of today's immunostains, be referred to as atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH or adenosis) Single, separate glands May be either minute or large and cyst-like; glands have an irregularly separated, ragged, poorly defined edge, looser than a nodule and are infiltrative Key feature is retention of at least a wisp of stroma intervening between neighboring glands Tangentially cut glands may appear as if they are poorly formed but should not get graded as a 4 unless poorly formed and fused glands persist on several levels  Patterns of Gleason grade 3 prostatic adenocarcinoma: Most common pattern is well formed, relatively uniform glands infiltrating between benign glands; glands may be angulated or compressed, separated by more than 1 gland diameter, , Small glands with pinpoint lumina, glands still separate, Medium sized glands with undulating luminal contours or large glands or branching, Large glands with a pseudoatrophic appearance, Cribriform cancer no longer qualifies as Gleason 3, even if the glands are similar in size to normal glands , Gleason grade 4, , Key finding is coalescent or fused glands with more than 1 lumen and absence of intervening stroma between adjacent glands, , Patterns of Gleason grade 4 prostatic adenocarcinoma:, Most common is small acinar structures, some with well formed lumina, fusing into cords or chains; may be undergraded as Gleason 3 Cribriform (often merging with papillary, see Microscopic (histologic) images) by consensus has a confluent sheet of contiguous malignant epithelial cells with multiple glandular lumina that are easily visible at low power (objective magnification 10x); there should be no intervening stroma or mucin separating individual or fused glandular structures (Ann Diagn Pathol 2021;52:151733, Am J Surg Pathol 2021;45:1118) Nodule of a cribriform gland should be larger than normal prostate gland, Large nodules of cribriform Gleason 4 lack supporting stroma and tend to fragment, Thus, fragments of cribriform glands on needle biopsy represent Gleason 4 Hypernephroid pattern, with nests of clear cells resembling renal cell carcinoma; small, hyperchromatic nuclei; fusion of acini into more solid sheets with the appearance of back to back glands without intervening stroma Intraductal carcinoma, when admixed with invasive carcinoma, should be counted as Gleason 4 and not counted separately for quantitation purposes Its presence and significance should be mentioned, This emphasizes the adverse influence which has a unique phenotype of certain driver mutations as shown by Khani et al.  Glomeruloid pattern (2014 consensus), a rare small cribriform variant, contains a tuft of cells that is mostly detached from its surrounding duct space except for a single point of attachment (see Microscopic (histologic) images) Hypernephroid pattern, with nests of clear cells resembling renal cell carcinoma; small, hyperchromatic nuclei; fusion of acini into more solid sheets with the appearance of back to back glands without intervening stroma Research and 2014 consensus support grading all cribriform cancer as Gleason 4 because the presence and amount of cribriform cancer carries a distinctly adverse prognosis for recurrence and for death from cancer  Its presence or absence in Gleason 4 cancer should be commented on Note: patients with Gleason 8 at biopsy may have Gleason 7 at prostatectomy due to unsampled Gleason 3, , , Note: basal cell markers are crucial in distinguishing cribriform high grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, cribriform intraductal carcinoma and invasive cribriform carcinoma, , , Rarely, pure intraductal carcinoma occurs in biopsy specimens Rare in totally embedded prostatectomies as shown by Robinson  In its pure form it should not be graded  Diagnosis of intraductal carcinoma has modest reproducibility , Gleason grade 5, , Grade 5 has 2 patterns:, , , Comedonecrosis: central necrosis with intraluminal necrotic cells or karyorrhexis within papillary / cribriform spaces; caution should be exercised since many such foci have demonstrable basal cells, making them intraductal carcinoma instead; thus, immunostaining is recommended if this would alter the grade group (Histopathology 2019;74:1081, Am J Surg Pathol 2018;42:1036), , Single cells, possibly forming cords, possibly with vacuoles (signet ring cells) but without glandular lumens; this pattern may mimic lymphocytes at low power Gleason 5 pattern has moderately good reproducibility, although certain patterns are more problematic  Gleason 5 cancer is often missed or underdiagnosed on needle biopsy  Presence of Gleason grade 5 in prostate biopsy specimens predicts higher rates of metastasis and death compared with Gleason 4+4=8 cancer and even the smallest amounts of 5 predict outcome after prostatectomy

01295_t029_main	endometrial carcinoma general
01295_t029_histology	Pathologic definition of carcinoma of the endometrium: Diagnosis of carcinoma is based on features indicative of invasion into the surrounding mesenchyme (endometrial stroma or myometrium) Stromal invasion is typically seen in the form of glandular confluence and complex architecture: loss of individual glandular contours with gland fusion, lack of intervening stroma and back to back architecture Invasion usually presents in cribriform, microacinar and solid architectural patterns; other helpful features are stromal desmoplasia (stroma has myofibroblasts, edema, inflammatory cells and myxoid change), stromal necrosis (stroma replaced by necrotic and inflammatory debris) or combinations of these findings between adjacent glands So called microcystic, elongated and fragmented (MELF) pattern of growth represents, by definition, invasion This pattern can be deceptive and easily missed at low power magnification Depth of myometrial invasion, cervical stromal involvement, serosal involvement and adnexal involvement are relevant to pT category (see staging), , , Histologic grading: Endometrioid and mucinous carcinomas are graded with a 3 tier system developed by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO): FIGO 1: predominant glandular growth and less than 5% nonsquamous solid component; glandular architecture is identified by the presence of patent lumina within the gland, relatively preserved polarity of the epithelium and absent to mild epithelial stratification FIGO 2: 6 - 50% nonsquamous solid component FIGO 3: more than 50% nonsquamous solid component Architectural grading described above is upgraded by 1 if there is severe nuclear atypia (pleomorphism, nuclear enlargement and nucleoli evident at low power magnification) Endometrioid carcinoma FIGO grade 2 purely based on cytologic atypia (that is, with severe atypia but architecturally well differentiated) is extremely rare and must be treated as a diagnosis of exclusion; it is imperative to first exclude serous and clear cell carcinoma In general, a 2 tier system can be also applied, with FIGO1 and FIGO2 being considered low grade and FIGO 3 being considered high grade Other carcinoma types (serous, clear cell, carcinosarcoma, undifferentiated, mixed) are by definition high grade Lymph node involvement: 2018 AJCC staging manual introduces different categories for lymph node metastases in gynecologic malignancies, mostly based on size Lymphovascular space invasion: Lymphovascular space invasion (LVI) is an independent predictor of nodal metastases and local recurrence , LVI is defined as tumor cells in a space lined by endothelial cells outside the immediate invasive border, Extent of LVI, not just the presence, correlates significantly with regional and distal lymph node involvement, locoregional recurrence and survival (Eur J Cancer 2015;51:1742, Histopathology 2019;75:128) Extent should be reported as follows: Absent: no LVI as defined, Focal: a single focus of LVI, Substantial: diffuse or multifocal LVSI Under this system, the term focus is understood as a cluster containing up to 5 individual involved vascular spaces It can be inferred that substantial LVI represents either more than 1 focus as defined or any focus with more than 5 individual involved vascular spaces Artificial tumor intrusion into vascular spaces (vascular pseudoinvasion) can be seen in laparoscopic, robotic assisted hysterectomies This phenomenon occurs not only in cancer related surgery: displacement of normal endometrial glands and stroma has been reported in 13% of laparoscopic hysterectomies performed for benign conditions  Of note, other studies have shown no association between laparoscopic hysterectomy or the use of a uterine manipulator and the prevalence of LVI  Real vascular invasion is seen in lymphatics and venous vessels, not in arterial vessels; intravascular foci are round and conform to the shape of the vessel; sometimes they are partially adherent to the vessel wall; cells have more eosinophilic cytoplasm and rounder shape compared with the native tumor; the presence of a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate also supports real LVI  Artificial intrusion should be considered if the intravascular tumor retains a gland shape or stromal elements within it, has a large size and involves arterial vessels or other elements are identified within vascular spaces (benign endometrium, surface necrotic material or exudates)

ectatic thin walled vessels may be seen, Bundles of smooth muscle within the stroma may be present, often in close proximity to thick walled blood vessels More prominent smooth muscle component may be seen  See also myomatous variant and adenomyoma in the Differential diagnosisFoci of decidua may be present (usually reflecting exogenous progestin use or pregnancy), Mitotic figures in the stromal cells may be present, Rarely, sex cord-like areas have been described  Conventional endometrial, endocervical, or adenomyomatous pedunculated, or sessile lesion with histologic features diagnostic of polyp , Glands: Glandular architecture out of phase with the background endometrium Angulated, tubular or cystically dilated Usually endometrioid in type: inactive, proliferative or functional May exhibit metaplastic changes, including ciliated, eosinophilic, mucinous and squamous metaplasia Proliferative activity in a polyp in a postmenopausal woman is of no clinical importance (if present in the nonpolypoid endometrium, it is useful to comment on) Polyps originating at the junction of the upper endocervix / lower uterine segment contain both endocervical and ciliated lower uterine segment type glands If present, the parallel arrangement of the long axis of the endometrial glands to the surface epithelium is a useful diagnostic finding; this feature is especially helpful in premenopausal women Tamoxifen associated endometrial polyps: Show fibrotic, sparsely cellular stroma, metaplastic glands including mucinous metaplasia, edema, decidualization or myxoid change, periglandular stromal epithelial metaplasia and shedding Staghorn shaped glands (dilated glands with stromal projections within their luminal spaces) polarized along the long axis of the polyps and periglandular stromal condensations in the absence of conspicuous mitotic activity have been also reported May be multiple and can recur Extensively necrotic polyps can be seen, secondary to torsion or if polyps outgrow their blood supply; vascular thrombosis and surface atypia may be seen in such cases, Variants: Endometrial polyp with atypical stromal cells: Presence of bizarre / atypical stromal cells in endometrial polyps and nonpolypoid endometrium has been documented in case reports and few series , Stromal cells show markedly atypical symplastic-like nuclei, resembling those seen elsewhere in the female genital tract (e.g., fibroepithelial stromal polyps of the vulva and vagina) , Mitotic figures are absent (useful feature to differentiate from adenosarcoma), No prominent nucleoli, Chromatin distribution is uniform with a smudged appearance (instead of coarse), Multinucleate forms may be seen, Atypical cells are usually focally scattered throughout the polyp, predominantly beneath the surface epithelium or at the base, Immunohistochemically, the atypical cells express vimentin, estrogen, progesterone and androgen receptors and may express desmin, CD10 and muscle specific actin  Atrophic: usually seen in postmenopausal women; low columnar to cuboidal epithelial lining, cystic dilatation of the glands and fibrotic stroma Functional: if secretory features are present, they are underdeveloped features compared with the background endometrium Myomatous: abundant smooth muscle in the stroma (versus adenomyoma: see Differential diagnosis)  Mixed polyps or polyp of mixed endometrial endocervical type Other rare findings include: Tuberculosis  Placental site trophoblastic tumor  Primary diffuse large B cell lymphoma  Intravascular large B cell lymphomas (Blood 2019;133:1920) Metastatic malignant melanoma  Sarcoidosis  Metastases of various carcinomas developing in endometrial polyps (e.g., cervical carcinoma) or rarer ones (e.g., breast lobular carcinoma or gallbladder adenocarcinoma) Must be carefully examined for foci of endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma: Diagnosis of nonatypical hyperplasia should not be made in a polyp, since proliferative activity with glandular dilatation is a feature Atypical hyperplasia: Diagnostic features similar to those in nonpolypoid endometrium, If these are confined to the polyp, it should be specified in the diagnosis (may not require additional therapy), However, in women with atypical hyperplasia in polyps, atypical hyperplasia and carcinoma in the background surrounding endometrium is not uncommon (it is useful to comment on if present in the nonpolypoid endometrium)  Endometrial carcinoma: Most commonly serous and endometrioid, Carcinomas found in polyps (tamoxifen related and unrelated) may be confined to the polyp or be part of a multifocal endometrial hyperplasia, Stains may be helpful to diagnose serous carcinoma Recently, it has been reported that most minimal uterine serous carcinomas arise in an endometrial polyp
