03628_t012_def01	renal oncocytoma is a benign (noncancerous) growth of the kidney. they generally do not cause any signs or symptoms and are often discovered incidentally (by chance) while a person is undergoing diagnostic imaging for other conditions. some people with renal oncocytoma will have abdominal or flank pain; blood in the urine; and/or an abdominal mass. although these tumors can occur in people of all ages, they most commonly develop in men who are over age 50. the exact underlying cause of most isolated (single tumor affecting one kidney) renal oncocytomas is unknown; however, multiple and bilateral (affecting both kidneys) renal oncocytomas sometimes occur in people with certain genetic syndromes such as tuberous sclerosis complex and birt-hogg-dube syndrome. although many benign tumors do not require treatment unless they are causing unpleasant symptoms, it can be difficult to confidently differentiate a renal oncocytoma from renal cell carcinoma. most affected people are, therefore, treated with surgery which allows for confirmation of the diagnosis. - this information is from gard/ordr/ncats.

01139_t025_def05	desmoid tumour can occur in any part of the body: extra-abdominally (neck, shoulders, upper limbs, gluteal region), abdominally (originating from muscle fascia or the abdominal/chest wall), and more rarely intra-abdominally in the mesentery or retroperitoneum. depending on the location of the tumour, symptoms may include pain, fever and functional impairment or loss of function of the organ involved. desmoid tumour results from the proliferation of well-differentiated myofibroblasts. the exact aetiopathogenetic mechanism is still unknown, but they seem to have a multi-factorial origin with hormonal and genetic factors being involved. somatic mutations in the ctnnb1 gene (3q21) encoding beta-catenin have been found in about 85% of sporadic cases.
01139_t025_def06	desmoid tumors are benign (noncancerous) growths of the connective tissue. although these tumors rarely spread to more distant parts of the body, they have a tendency to invade surrounding tissues and can be very difficult to remove. signs and symptoms vary from person to person and largely depend on the size and location of the tumor; however, many affected people experience pain, numbness, and/or tingling. the cause of desmoid tumors is unknown, but they sometimes occur in people with certain conditions such as familial adenomatous polyposis (fap). treatment consists of surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or hormone therapy may also be used in some cases. - this information is from gard/ordr/ncats.

00365_t006_def02	a humanized, fc optimized, monoclonal antibody directed against the protein ligand pd-l1 (programmed cell death-1 ligand 1; cd274), with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic activities. atezolizumab binds to pd-l1, blocking its binding to and activation of its receptor programmed death 1 (pd-1; pdcd1) expressed on activated t-cells, which may enhance the t-cell-mediated immune response to neoplasms and reverse t-cell inactivation. in addition, by binding to pd-l1, atezolizumab also prevents binding of this ligand to b7.1 (cd80) expressed on activated t cells, which further enhances the t-cell-mediated immune response. pd-l1 is overexpressed on many human cancer cell types and on various tumor-infiltrating immune cells. pd-l1 binding to pd-1 on t-cells suppresses the immune system and results in increased immune evasion. pd-1, a transmembrane protein, is a negative regulator of the immune system that limits the expansion and survival of cd8+ t cells. the fc region of atezolizumab is modified in such a way that it does not induce either antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (adcc) or complement-dependent cytotoxicity (cdc).

03060_t011_main	osteomyelitis overview
03060_t011_def00	osteomyelitis of the jaws is predominantly a disease of the mandible, because the maxilla is vascular with thin cortical plates and less frequently involved
03060_t011_def01	infection of the jaws, due to its unique feature bearing teeth and connecting to the oral cavity / oral environment with the periodontal membrane, differs in several important aspects from osteomyelitis of long bones
03060_t011_def02	osteomyelitis of the jaws is still fairly common in maxillofacial clinics and offices despite the introduction of antibiotics and the improvement of dental and medical care
03060_t011_def03	classifications are based on different aspects such as clinical course, pathological anatomical or radiological features, etiology and pathogenesis
03060_t011_def04	ischemia can lead infected bone to become necrotic and sequester which is considered a classical sign of osteomyelitis
03060_t011_def05	originates from greek words osteon (bone) and muelinos , while the original derivation emphasizes involvement of marrow, common medical literature extends the definition to an inflammation process of the entire bone including cortex and periosteum, recognizing that the pathological process is rarely confined to the medullary portion, osteomyelitis has been used to encompass a wide variety of pathoses / etiologies, such as traumatic injuries, radiation, and certain chemical substances, but the term is mostly often used to describe infection of the bone
03060_t011_def06	a mixture of these classification systems is often used, leading to confusion, hindering comparative studies and obscuring classification criteria
03060_t011_def07	classification is primarily based on clinical course and imaging
03060_t011_def08	the zurich system of osteomyelitis is generally accepted as the most reliable classification for osteomyelitis
03060_t011_def09	this is reflected by the longstanding recognition of osteomyelitis of jawbones as a clinical entity which differs in many important aspects from that in long bones; hence, a wide variety of classifications, specifically for the jawbones, have been established
03060_t011_def10	when infection becomes established, pus or edema in the medullary cavity and beneath the periosteum can compromise the local blood supply
03060_t011_def11	the specific local immunological and microbiological aspects determine a major factor in the etiology and pathogenesis of this disease and hence also have a direct impact on its treatment; therefore, to extrapolate from long bone infections to disease of the jaws has limitations
