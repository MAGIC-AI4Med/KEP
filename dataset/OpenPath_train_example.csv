laion_en_0.jpg|Immunohistochemical detection of LMP2A and double immunohistochemical staining for LMP2A and CK7.A) Ductal breast carcinoma with a high number of LMP2A positive cells. Positive signal for LMP2A is restricted to the cytoplasm and membrane of tumor epithelial cells (1000X). B) LMP2A negative ductal carcinoma tissue (1000X). C) Ductal breast carcinoma. Positive double signal for LMP2A (brown signal, dotted arrow) and CK7 (blue signal, full arrow) restricted to the cytoplasm and membrane of the same tumor epithelial cells (1000X).
